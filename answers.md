Activity 5:


Buggy1-Deck.java

Possible Code Error:
The isEmpty() method in the Deck Class has not been created correctly because it runs false even
though the deck is empty and it should be running true. There is probably just a simple error with what variable was used to find the size.



Buggy2-Deck.java

Possible Code Error:
The size() method in the Deck classis written incorrectly, the real size of the D deck is only 1 card while the test says the Deck is empty which is incorrect. They probably used the wrong variable or had the wrong method to find the size.



Buggy3-Card.java

Possible Code Error:
The matches() method written in Card is written incorrectly whilethe decks should 100% match as they are the same, they don't end up macthing. A possible error could be comparing the wrong things or comparing them in the incorrect order different than what the array list should show.


Buggy4-Deck.java

Possible Code error:
the Deal() method is incorrect in how it finds if the deck is empty and it can't deal. The method ran null even though there is actually a card in that deck. So the size method used earlier is messing up if it's returning null or not.
